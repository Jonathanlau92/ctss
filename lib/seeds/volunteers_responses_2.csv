With the month-long school closure, their learning will be disrupted and is definitely not an easy time for them. I have heard of many incidents where the students, especially those from less privileged families, were unable to find external help during this circuit breaker and were facing pressure coping with their academic demands. 

I hope to be able to commit myself to meaningful and fulfilling activities during this difficult time when many others are facing problems and difficulties. I really want to be able to help these students who are facing academic problems during this time, especially those who do not have access or have little access to private/home tuition and academic help.
