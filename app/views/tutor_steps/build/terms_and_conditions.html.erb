        <p>In the CTSS programme, it is of utmost importance to us that our registered students are safe. 
        It is essential that no student should be harmed during his/her interactions with the volunteers 
        and the team from CTSS. This code of conduct is carried out in line with our feedback form for every 
        session, to ensure transparency and accountability of tutors and students to the CTSS team. Given that 
        the mode of tutoring is online and will be remote, this is crucial to follow. As a volunteer, you have 
        to comply with this code of conduct and the usual laws of the Republic of Singapore. If you fail to do 
        so, you will be given a warning from the CTSS team or be asked to stop volunteering immediately. Thus, 
        please read the following points carefully and follow them!</p>
          
        <p>1) Photography and videography of the students are strictly not allowed.</p>

        <p>2) You have to observe online etiquette. If you and your student are using the webcam, ensure that 
        whatever is visible to the student is neither rude, offensive, nor have the appearance of being sexual. </p>
    
        <p>3) Any interaction with the student beyond regular tutoring sessions and the subject of teaching (for e.g. 
        the student texting you a question) must be reported to the CTSS team at enquiries.ctss@gmail.com</p>

        <p>4) During a tutoring session, if you observe that the student's basic well-being or safety is compromised, 
        please let the CTSS team know immediately so we can render further assistance. If the student alerts you to 
        his/her difficult family situation, let us know as well.</p>

        <p>5) Never speak to students in a derogatory way, or in a way which discriminates or alienates them. Discrimination 
        and racism will not be tolerated.</p>
