        <p>In the CTSS programme, it is of utmost importance to us that our volunteers are safe. 
          It is essential that no volunteers should be harmed during his/her interactions with the 
          students and the team from CTSS. This code of conduct is carried out in line with our 
          feedback form for every session, to ensure transparency and accountability of tutors and 
          students to the CTSS team. Given that the mode of tutoring is online and will be remote, 
          this is crucial to follow. 
          
          As a student, you have to follow these rules, and the usual laws of the Republic of Singapore. 
          If you fail to do so, you will be given a warning from the CTSS team or be asked to withdraw 
          from the programme immediately. Thus, please read the following points carefully and follow them!

          1) Photography and videography of the volunteer tutors are strictly not allowed. 

          2) You have to observe online etiquette. If you and your tutor are using the webcam, ensure that 
          whatever is visible to the volunteer is neither rude, offensive, nor have the appearance of being sexual. 

          3) Never speak to volunteers in an offensive way, or in a way which discriminates or hurts them. 
          Discrimination and racism will not be tolerated.
